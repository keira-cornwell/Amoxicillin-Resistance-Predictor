### Project Overview
This project created a binary logistic regression model for predicting if a given bacteria sample will be susceptible or resistant to amoxicillin. Antibiotic resistance is a critical public health concern, contributing to over one million deaths annually. With amoxicillin being the most commonly prescribed antibiotic, it's important to not only understand if a given bacteria sample will be resistant to amoxicillin, but also what drives antibiotic resistance for amoxicillin.\
